# Currency Converter
### Build a script to convert money from one currency to another
In this project, you will create a program that uses real-world exchange rates to create a currency converter that allows one to convert money within these currencies: **KSH**, **USD**, and **EUR**.

| From currency X | To currency Y |
|---|---|
| 1 USD	| KSH 112.50
| 1 EUR	| KSH 132.45
| 1 EUR	| USD 1.20

- Use the currency exchange rates above for for your currency converter program (These ghave been curated by the Chaptr Content Team)
- Create input forms that allows a user to input the monetary amount, what currency it is in, and what currency they’d love to convert it to
- Utilise conditional statements to create a script that will make a currency as per the the user’s needs using the exchange rates listed above
- Use the try/except to catch any errors the user might have inputed into their inputs. This should avoid errors in case someone misspells the currency or adds text into the money input form. If an error is caught allow the user to make the inputs afresh.
- Finally, always convert your final output to two decimal places as required by all currencies
