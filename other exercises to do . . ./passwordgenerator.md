# Secure Password Generator
### Create a Python Script to Generate Secure Passwords
Nowadays, each and every person needs numerous account for different applications they use for their day to day tasks. Whether this is Facebook, PayPal or the Chaptr LMS, most of us open 20+ accounts across different applications. This makes it extremely impossible to keep up with the need for new usernames and passwords. Most of us have resorted to using one password, but is that really secure? Once one application is hacked, malicious actors can easily gain access to your other accounts. In this project, we will attempt to create a very secure password generator to help us internet users.

Follow the following parameters in processing and outputing a secure password from your Python script:

- The password should be at least 8 characters long and should contain:
  - At least one lowercase letter
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - At least one numeric digit from 0-9
  - At least one special character from this list: **!@#$%^&*()**
- Make sure the position of all types of characters are purely randomised
- Your password should be no longer than 15 characters
- Utilize the random and string libraries to randomizes charcter choices and generate alphanumeric charactr lists respectively

Is there anything you could add to make the password more secure? Feel free to surprise us but the stipulations above should output a very secure password that is hard to guess in any way.
